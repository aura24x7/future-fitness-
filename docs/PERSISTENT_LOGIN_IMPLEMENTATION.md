# Persistent Login Implementation Plan

## Current Issue
- Users have to log in every time they open the application
- Firebase authentication state is not persisting between app launches
- Previous implementation was causing errors with persistence

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Firebase Authentication Persistence
   - Previous implementation used browserLocalPersistence which is not suitable for React Native
   - Need to use AsyncStorage for persistence instead
   - Need proper error handling for persistence failures

2. AsyncStorage Implementation
   - Need two-layer persistence strategy:
     1. AUTH_PERSISTENCE_KEY for auth state
     2. AUTH_CREDENTIALS_KEY for auto-login

3. Auth State Management
   - Need proper initialization sequence
   - Need better error handling
   - Need proper cleanup on errors

## Latest Changes Made

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`src/config/firebase.ts`)
- [x] Removed browserLocalPersistence
- [x] Simplified Firebase initialization
- [x] Removed problematic persistence code

### 2. Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- [x] Implemented two-layer persistence strategy
- [x] Added proper initialization sequence:
  1. Check persisted auth state
  2. Try auto-login with saved credentials
  3. Handle auth state changes
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling
- [x] Added proper cleanup on errors
- [x] Added detailed logging for debugging

### 3. AsyncStorage Implementation
- [x] Using AUTH_PERSISTENCE_KEY for auth state
- [x] Using AUTH_CREDENTIALS_KEY for credentials
- [x] Added proper error handling
- [x] Added cleanup on invalid data

## Current Status
- ✅ Fixed persistence errors
- ✅ Implemented proper auto-login
- ✅ Added error handling
- ✅ Added logging for debugging
- ✅ No changes to UI/UX
- ✅ Maintained existing functionality

## Testing Required
1. Fresh Install Testing
   - [ ] Install app fresh
   - [ ] Login once
   - [ ] Close app completely
   - [ ] Reopen app and verify auto-login

2. Error Handling
   - [ ] Test invalid credentials
   - [ ] Test network errors
   - [ ] Test persistence errors

3. Edge Cases
   - [ ] Test multiple logins
   - [ ] Test logout scenarios
   - [ ] Test app force close

## Next Steps
1. Testing
   - [ ] Perform all test scenarios
   - [ ] Monitor error logs
   - [ ] Verify no UI/UX changes

2. Monitoring
   - [ ] Monitor auto-login success rate
   - [ ] Track persistence errors
   - [ ] Monitor cleanup effectiveness

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Document error handling
   - [ ] Document recovery procedures
   - [ ] Update troubleshooting guide

## Success Criteria
1. App maintains login state between restarts
2. No errors in Firebase initialization
3. Proper error handling and recovery
4. No changes to existing UI/UX
5. No impact on other features

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep backup of current implementation
2. Document all changes
3. Maintain ability to revert
4. Test rollback procedures

## Notes
- Current implementation uses AsyncStorage instead of Firebase persistence
- Two-layer persistence strategy for better reliability
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- No changes to UI/UX or existing features
