# Weight Tracking Component Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phases involved in removing the legacy Weight Progress component and developing a new, robust Weight Tracking component for the Future Fitness application. The new component will not only track user weight changes using aggregated calorie data, but also provide actionable insights and recommended calorie intake.

## Phase 1: Removal of Legacy Component [✓]
- Remove the Weight Progress Section from the Analytics screen.
- Delete associated component files:
  - `src/components/analytics/WeightProgressSection.tsx`
  - `src/components/analytics/WeightProgressChart.tsx`
  - `src/components/analytics/WeightProgressSimple.tsx`
  - `src/components/weight/WeightProgressCard.tsx`
  - `src/hooks/useWeightProgress.ts`
- Ensure that removals do not introduce errors or side effects.

## Phase 2: Data Aggregation and Source Identification [✓]
- Identify and document core data sources from Firebase:
  - User meal data stored under `/users/<userId>/meals` (fields: calories, carbs, fat, protein, timestamp, etc.).
  - Weight logs, goals, and settings maintained via the WeightContext and weightService.
- Verify Firebase data persistence to ensure historical data remains available in case of app reinstallation.

## Phase 3: Development of Calculation Foundation [✓]
- Create a new custom hook, e.g., `useWeightTracking`, to:
  - Aggregate daily calorie data over 7-day intervals.
  - Calculate calorie surplus/deficit and estimate weight change using conversion factors (e.g., 3500 calories ≈ 1 lb or 7700 calories ≈ 1 kg).
  - Optionally include user-specific recommended daily calorie intake for enhanced insights.
- Ensure calculation logic is robust and accounts for edge cases (insufficient data, missing days, etc.).

## Phase 4: UI/UX Component Design [✓]
- Develop a new component (e.g., `WeightTrackingCard` or `WeightTrackingComponent`) with:
  - A clean, interactive card layout.
  - Display of weekly aggregated data: total calorie intake, estimated weight change, and goal progress.
  - Visual elements (progress bars, charts, etc.) that align with Future Fitness's modern design, using Tamagui components.
  - Responsive design for consistent experience on all platforms.

## Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- Integrate the new weight tracking component into the Analytics screen alongside other analytics components.
- Extend existing contexts and services if additional data endpoints are required.
- Implement error handling and loading states gracefully.
- Write unit tests for:
  - The custom hook calculations (weekly aggregation & weight estimation).
  - The new component's rendering and interaction.
- Conduct cross-platform testing on iOS and Android.

## Phase 6: Documentation and Future Enhancements
- Update internal documentation and inline comments to capture:
  - Data flow and calculation logic.
  - Component usage within the Analytics module.
- Maintain a changelog for future improvements and feature enhancements.
- Tag for review and further iteration: second tagger proofs

This phased approach ensures a systematic, data-driven, and modern solution for weight tracking, paving the way for enhanced user insights and a superior user experience.
