Phase 1: Diagnostics & Verification
Goal: Identify exact failure points and verify infrastructure
Firestore Setup Verification:
- [x] Check Firestore rules for 'users/{userId}/meals' path
- [x] Verify indexes for timestamp-based queries
- [x] Confirm authentication rules are correct
Add Diagnostic Logging:
- [x] Log Firestore save attempts
- [x] Log sync operation status
- [x] Log data loading attempts
- [x] Track user authentication state
Test Current Flow:
- [ ] Test meal addition
- [ ] Monitor data persistence
- [ ] Check sync operations
- [ ] Verify data loading on login
Phase 2: Core Fixes
Goal: Fix fundamental data persistence issues
Firestore Save Operation:
- [x] Implement proper error handling
- [x] Add save verification
- [x] Fix collection path issues
- [x] Add retry mechanism
Sync Process:
- [x] Fix sync scheduling
- [x] Implement immediate sync
- [x] Add sync completion verification
- [x] Handle offline scenarios
Data Loading:
- [x] Fix loadUserMeals implementation
- [x] Add data validation
- [x] Implement proper error recovery
- [x] Handle missing data scenarios
Phase 3: Reliability Improvements
Goal: Enhance data consistency and reliability
#### Data Consistency
- [x] Implement version control for meal documents
- [x] Add conflict resolution mechanisms
- [x] Handle edge cases (partial updates, concurrent modifications)
- [x] Add data integrity checks

#### Offline Support
- [x] Improve local storage handling
- [x] Add queue for pending operations
- [x] Implement sync scheduling
