# Future Fitness Application Cleanup Project

## Overview
This document combines the cleanup plan and verification steps for removing unused and duplicate files in the Future Fitness application. The cleanup will be executed in phases to ensure stability and maintain application functionality.

## Current Progress
### Phase 1: Remove Duplicate Files âœ“
Status: Completed
- [x] Dashboard.tsx and DashboardComponents.tsx removed
- [x] Food.tsx and FoodComponents.tsx removed
- [x] FoodLog.tsx and FoodLogComponents.tsx removed

### Phase 2: Remove Unused Features
Status: Ready to Start

Screens to Remove:
1. Group-Related Screens:
   - [ ] GroupWorkoutsScreen.tsx
   - [ ] GroupAnalyticsScreen.tsx
   - [ ] GroupChallengesScreen.tsx
   - [ ] CreateGroupScreen.tsx
   - [ ] GroupDetailsScreen.tsx
   - [ ] InviteMembersScreen.tsx
   - [ ] ManageInvitesScreen.tsx

2. Workout-Related Screens:
   - [ ] CreateWorkoutScreen.tsx
   - [ ] ShareWorkoutScreen.tsx
   - [ ] SelectWorkoutScreen.tsx
   - [ ] AddCustomWorkoutScreen.tsx
   - [ ] WorkoutDetails.tsx

3. Related Services:
   - [ ] groupService.ts
   - [ ] workoutSocialService.ts
   - [ ] workoutSharingService.ts
   - [ ] manualWorkoutService.ts

### Quick Verification Steps
1. Build Check:
   - [ ] Run yarn build
   - [ ] Check for TypeScript errors
   - [ ] Verify no runtime errors

2. Feature Check:
   - [ ] Verify main navigation
   - [ ] Test core features
   - [ ] Check for console errors

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Use backup branch: `backup/phase1-cleanup`
2. Restore from backup directory
3. Revert changes in git

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Phase 2:
1. Batch remove group-related files
2. Batch remove workout-related files
3. Remove unused services
4. Quick verification
5. Update documentation

Would you like to proceed with Phase 2?

## Pre-Cleanup Global Checklist
- [x] Create a git branch for cleanup: `backup/phase1-cleanup`
- [x] Take a snapshot of current bundle size
- [x] Document current app performance metrics
- [x] Create backup of entire codebase
- [x] Run and document all existing tests

## Verification Checklist Template
(Use for each file before removal)

### 1. Usage Analysis
#### Import Analysis
- [ ] Run grep search for imports
  ```bash
  grep -r "import.*fileName" src/
  ```
- [ ] Check dynamic imports
  ```bash
  grep -r "require.*fileName" src/
  ```
- [ ] Check string references
  ```bash
  grep -r "fileName" src/
  ```

#### Navigation Check
- [ ] Check MainNavigator.tsx
- [ ] Check TabNavigator.tsx
- [ ] Check route definitions
- [ ] Verify deep linking
- [ ] Check navigation types

#### Dependencies Check
- [ ] Component inheritance
- [ ] Component composition
- [ ] HOC usage
- [ ] Context usage
- [ ] Service dependencies
- [ ] Event listeners
- [ ] Background tasks

### 2. Removal Process
1. Create backup if not exists
2. Comment out imports
3. Test application
4. Remove file
5. Update documentation

### 3. Post-Removal Verification
- [ ] Run complete test suite
- [ ] Check all main user flows
- [ ] Verify build process
- [ ] Check for runtime errors
- [ ] Monitor error reporting

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Bundle size reduction target: 25%
- [ ] Improved TypeScript compilation time
- [ ] Reduced number of files
- [ ] Cleaner dependency tree
- [ ] Improved app performance
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] No UI/UX changes in current features

## Emergency Rollback Plan
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Revert to backup branch
   - Restore from backup directory
   - Run verification tests
   - Check data integrity

2. Analysis:
   - Document failure points
   - Review verification process
   - Update cleanup plan
   - Document lessons learned

## Notes
- Each phase must be committed separately
- Run tests after each significant change
- Document any unexpected dependencies
- Update documentation as we progress
- Maintain UI/UX consistency
- Preserve all current functionality
