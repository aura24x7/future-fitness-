Workout Sharing Feature - Detailed Design
Core Concept
The goal is to create a seamless way for users to share their entire week's workout plan with individuals or groups they've already added, with a simple sharing mechanism and notification-based acceptance.
Feature Breakdown
1. Sharing Interface

Add a share icon on the workout screen (top right or bottom right corner)
When clicked, open a sharing modal/bottom sheet

2. Sharing Modal Components

Two primary sharing options:
a) Share to Groups
b) Share to Individuals
Only show groups and individuals that the user has already added in their profile/group screen
Prevent sharing to random contacts outside the app

3. Sharing Process Workflow
Step 1: Initiate Share

User clicks share icon on workout screen
App prepares the entire week's workout plan for sharing

Step 2: Select Recipients

User can:

Select multiple groups
Select multiple individuals
Or a combination of both



Step 3: Send Share Request

Generate a unique share request ID
Create a share request object with:

Sender details
Full workout plan
Recipient list
Timestamp
Status (pending)



4. Recipient Experience
For Individuals

Receive notification: "[Username] wants to share a workout plan"
Options: Accept or Reject
If Accept:

Workout plan gets copied to their workout screen
Mark as synced


If Reject:

Simple dismissal
No further action



For Groups

Group notification: "[Username] shared a workout plan with the group"
Each group member sees the notification
Individual members can:

Accept for themselves
Reject for themselves



5. Backend Data Model
javascriptCopy{
  shareRequest: {
    id: "unique_share_id",
    sender: {
      userId: "sender_user_id",
      name: "Sender Name"
    },
    workoutPlan: {
      // Full week's workout details
      monday: { ... },
      tuesday: { ... },
      // ... other days
    },
    recipients: {
      individuals: ["user_id1", "user_id2"],
      groups: ["group_id1", "group_id2"]
    },
    status: {
      overall: "pending", // or "completed"
      individualStatuses: {
        "user_id1": "accepted", // or "rejected" or "pending"
        "user_id2": "pending"
      },
      groupStatuses: {
        "group_id1": {
          "overall": "pending",
          "memberStatuses": {
            "member_user_id1": "accepted",
            "member_user_id2": "rejected"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    timestamp: "datetime"
  }
}
6. Notification System

Push notifications for:

Share request received
Share request status change (accepted/rejected)


In-app notifications list
Real-time updates

7. Database Considerations

Use a flexible NoSQL structure (like Firebase or MongoDB)
Allow easy querying of share requests
Implement TTL (Time To Live) for old share requests

Implementation Phases

Design UI for share modal
Implement backend share request model
Create sharing logic
Develop notification system
Implement acceptance/rejection workflow
Add error handling and edge cases
Thorough testing

Key Technical Considerations

Ensure real-time sync
Optimize performance for large groups
Secure sharing mechanism
Minimal data transfer
Smooth user experience

Potential Challenges to Address

Handling network issues during share
Managing large group shares
Preventing spam
Ensuring data consistency

Recommended Tech Stack Components

Frontend: React Native
Backend: Node.js with Socket.io for real-time
Database: Firebase/Firestore
Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging
