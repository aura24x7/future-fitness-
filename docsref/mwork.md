Requirements Analysis:

Manual Workout Creation:
Users need to create custom weekly workout plans
Each day should have customizable workout details
Support for multiple exercises per workout
Ability to specify exercise details (sets, reps, duration, etc.)
Workout Sharing:
Share workouts with friends from groups/individuals list
Real-time workout sharing capabilities
Notification system for shared workouts
Accept/decline shared workout options
Implementation Plan:

Phase 1: Data Structure & Storage

typescript
CopyInsert
// Types for workout management
interface Exercise {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  sets: number;
  reps: number | 'AMRAP';
  duration?: number;
  weight?: number;
  notes?: string;
}

interface DailyWorkout {
  id: string;
  dayOfWeek: string;
  exercises: Exercise[];
  notes?: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

interface WorkoutPlan {
  id: string;
  createdBy: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  weeklyPlan: DailyWorkout[];
  sharedWith: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface WorkoutShare {
  id: string;
  workoutPlanId: string;
  senderId: string;
  receiverId: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'declined';
  sharedAt: Date;
}
Phase 2: UI Components Development

Create Workout Form:
Day selector
Exercise input form
Set/rep counter
Notes section
Save/update buttons
Workout Sharing UI:
Friend selector
Share confirmation dialog
Shared workout notifications
Accept/decline interface
Phase 3: Backend Services

typescript
CopyInsert
// Service structure
interface WorkoutManagementService {
  // Workout CRUD operations
  createWorkoutPlan(plan: Partial<WorkoutPlan>): Promise<WorkoutPlan>;
  updateWorkoutPlan(id: string, updates: Partial<WorkoutPlan>): Promise<WorkoutPlan>;
  deleteWorkoutPlan(id: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Sharing operations
  shareWorkout(workoutId: string, receiverId: string): Promise<WorkoutShare>;
  acceptSharedWorkout(shareId: string): Promise<WorkoutPlan>;
  declineSharedWorkout(shareId: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Queries
  getMyWorkouts(): Promise<WorkoutPlan[]>;
  getSharedWorkouts(): Promise<WorkoutPlan[]>;
  getPendingShares(): Promise<WorkoutShare[]>;
}
Phase 4: Implementation Steps

Create Data Layer (2-3 hours):
Implement data models
Set up storage service
Create CRUD operations
Build UI Components (4-5 hours):
Workout creation form
Exercise input components
Share workout interface
Notification components
Implement Services (3-4 hours):
Workout management service
Sharing service
Real-time updates
Integration (2-3 hours):
Connect UI with services
Implement error handling
Add loading states
Testing & Refinement (2-3 hours):
Unit tests
Integration tests
UI/UX refinements
Would you like me to proceed with implementing Phase 1 - Data Structure & Storage first? We can then move through each phase systematically while ensuring everything works as expected.

This approach will:

Keep existing AI workout functionality intact
Provide a clean separation of concerns
Enable scalable workout sharing
Create a user-friendly interface
Support real-time updates
Handle errors gracefully
Let me know if you want to proceed with Phase 1, or if you'd like to discuss any adjustments to the plan.
